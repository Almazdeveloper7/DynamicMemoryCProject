Technical assignment:

1. Create a C program that:
2. Asks the user to input the size of an integer array.
3. Allocates memory dynamically using either malloc() or calloc() (based on user input).
4. Prompts the user to enter the elements of the array.
5. Uses a function (e.g. FindMinMax) to find the minimum and maximum values in the array using pointers.
6. Asks the user whether they want to reallocate memory.
7. If yes, uses realloc() to resize the array and accepts additional numbers.
8. Frees the dynamically allocated memory using free() at the end.
